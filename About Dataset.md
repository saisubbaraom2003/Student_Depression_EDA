# **About Dataset**
A student depression dataset typically contains data aimed at analyzing, understanding, and predicting depression levels among students. It may include features such as demographic information (age, gender), academic performance (grades, attendance), lifestyle habits (sleep patterns, exercise, social activities), mental health history, and responses to standardized depression scales.

These datasets are valuable for research in psychology, data science, and education to identify factors contributing to student depression and to design early intervention strategies. Ethical considerations like privacy, informed consent, and anonymization of data are crucial in working with such sensitive information.
